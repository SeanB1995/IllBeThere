	The month started with a member of corporate services division over to check on the progress and discuss the future direction of the project. She was joined in the meeting was attended by supervisor, line manager and another member of the team before coming over to my desk for a demo. However essential updates in the midst of installing instead forced a verbal run through with the aid of screenshots. The feedback received was positive with surprise expressed at the overall progress of the project. Some things like the colour scheme and making the website accessible to all were brought up as necessary improvements needed. A comprehensive document containing all the notes from the meeting with all points made by both sides was sent on to me.
	On the back of the meeting, a work schedule was then created by the software dev, signed off by my supervisor. Effectively this contained a list of all task required for the project with a grading of easy, medium or hard attached to each so everyone will have a fair idea of each tasks respective difficulty.
	To create the tables in the database to store needed to store all necessary information relating to the project required some thought and a lot of time as there were a lot different factors to factor in. For example in part other already created tables can be used but some extra details were needed so this meant creating new tables but using the premade ones as a template. This was done on paper first with the help of the software developer where a map of the flow of the tables was drawn out. External help was then sought as to how the tables can be created as the database is a central one so had to be careful to not conflict with other tables as it could affect other projects. Only when the database was sorted could functionality work continue.
	With the user end which I worked on, and the admin side of the project which another intern worked on, at an approved design stage while the database tables were in the process of being created, the next step was to code merge. Connecting the two was also necessary for the work schedule tasks as many upcoming tasks rely on the two connected to 
complexity of work schedule task functionalities needing to be connected to work,   
-To do this - open merge request
-Fine combed through, discussion on validity of many lines of code
-Resolve many dead ends – Some broke website had to be fixed
