	Starting off the placement I had to first report to revenue HR offices in Dublin Castle or Corporate Services Division to be exact. The main function of this was to sign all the contracts but this is the first place I learned what my exact role entails and who I will be working with rather in a strange way as straight off the bat a senior member of CSD came to state that two of the ten interns in the room would be working with closely with on an internal web application, one of the two was me. Upon first entry to the building in Castle View where I will be based, a brief presentation followed along with a general tour around the building and then each intern would be split into their respective teams. The team I joined was the Programme Management Office or PMO for short which is a team of about thirty. An informal meet and greet with the team followed. The head of the PMO is Mairead Finn although the Product Support Team Leader, Alan Meade is the person I will be working closer to and reporting to. The main role of the PMO is developing and enhancing new and existing in house applications of all ranges. The continuous improvement team of the PMO then gave a PMO specific presentation with a Q & A session. The main basis of this was to show the knowledge base of the team has the vast majority of the team are on non tech roles with unforeseen role titles of which I have no previous knowledge of.
	As the first week progressed the other intern and I worked a lot closer to the main software developer, Donal. The project of which I will be working on with Donal and another intern was assigned to me in a meeting with Alan and Donal. A thirty page business requirement spec contained all the information for the scope of the project. It is an internal Revenue competition web application called RevCompetetions which will allow for a system of all six thousand revenue employees to apply internally for jobs with the ability to track applications through the whole process in the web application. There will be two sections, one for employees and one for admins in HR. The project will be using AngularJS in the front end and Java in the backend.  Such a project certainly gave me an overwhelming feeling with a lot of work output needed especially has I have no experience of AngularJS or even using Java in the backend. Alan made it clear to keep it simple as possible at the start to build on it as needed. There are also data protection issues which will need to be carefully considered. The requirement spec followed the priority system of MoSCoW analysis which I am familiar with and need to stick to.
Setting up the correct environment on the computers proved to be extremely time consuming as the software to get the correct servers aligned with the Spring framework IDE of which all Revenue projects are done on, again something I have never experienced before. So many rules, dependencies and exceptions to the firewall as well as just the general installation of both Spring and Wamp Server ended up taking the majority of time in the first week. Donal was needed to show me all the intricacies which I need to know as this may have to be done again. 
There was also another visit to CSD for a
