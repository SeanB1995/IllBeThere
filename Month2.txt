     I commenced project work by starting on the project homepage of which I have a bit of creative leeway. As this project is a team effort between the other intern and I while the software developer will help while he can, we decided to split the project up into pages and use GitHub to merge the project when the time comes. Within a day or so I had a rough looking skeleton formed by a combo of HTML, CSS and a slight bit of Angular and keeping in the theme of other internal Revenue web apps. A scrum meeting followed where I presented the shell of the project homepage. A small bit of superficial feedback was received but at this stage of the design a lot more work was needed before serious feedback can be given.
