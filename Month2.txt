	I commenced project work by starting on the project homepage of which I have a bit of creative leeway. As this project is a team effort between the other intern and I while the software developer will help while he can, we decided to split the project up into pages and use GitHub to merge the project when the time comes. Within a day or so I had a rough looking skeleton formed by a combo of HTML, CSS and a slight bit of Angular and keeping in the theme of other internal Revenue web apps. A scrum meeting followed where I presented the shell of the project homepage. A small bit of superficial feedback was received but at this stage of the design a lot more work was needed before serious feedback can be given.
	After several delays due to weather I kept developing on my own initiative on how it should look and function. I decided to develop modals on the majority of pages using bootstrap and created tabs inside these with HTML, CSS and JavaScript to help concise information. 
	As a way of helping me understand the software developer recommended I start some simple functionality tasks involving connecting the back end to the front end even if they have to change as the project goes on as developing functionality will take up most times in the coming months. To do this I have to connect the front end to the back end using Angular and Java.
